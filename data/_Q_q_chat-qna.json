Procedure: To avail this facility,  officers need to fill up the application form in Annexure 1 along with an estimate for the treatment, from doctor / surgeon and submit it to concerned Business  HR  for  verification  and  onward  transmission  to  Corporate  Insurance  Department.  Corporate Insurance will verify the eligibility and send the request to CMO. CMO will examine all relevant details of the request and recommend (or otherwise) sanction of advance to the approving authority. Advance amount will be released subsequent to approval.\n\n2.  \n\n  Within 60 days from the date of discharge from the hospital, the officer needs to submit the application for Mediclaim. The claim amount received will be adjusted against the advance disbursed. In case the hospitalization expenses are in excess of the eligibility under Mediclaim scheme, differential amount will be recovered from the officer's salary in maximum 6 or 12 or 24 equal monthly installments. In case there is an admissibility under Medical Fund Scheme, the  same  may  be  applied  for  separately  which  will  be  processed  as  per  provisions  of  the scheme. In case the expenses incurred are less than the advance taken, the balance needs to be returned within 2 weeks of discharge from the hospital.\n\n3.  \n\n  Officers  can  avail  a  maximum  advance  of  6  months  of  monthly  basic  salary  or  up  to  base Mediclaim  coverage  /  sum  insured  (excluding  any  top-up  coverage  availed  by  officer), whichever is higher. The concerned officer, processing officials and approving authority will exercise  due  discretion  in  deciding  the  amount  of  advance  as  per  need  and  nature  of  the ailment and treatment. Recovery of monetary advance will be as follows:\n\nAmount to be recovered\n\nNumber of months\n\nLess than 4 times of Basic Salary\n\n6\n\n4 times - 6 times of Basic Salary\n\n12\n\nMore than 6 times of Basic Salary (where sum insured is higher than 6 times of basic salary)\n\n24\n\nIn case an officer does not submit the Mediclaim application within 90 days of availing the monetary advance or within 60 days of discharge from the hospital, whichever is earlier, the recovery of the monetary advance will start from the officer's next payable monthly salary as per provisions in Clause 2.4 [c].",
